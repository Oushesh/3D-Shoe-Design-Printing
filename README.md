Read on Above and check modelling. We know now: There is huge potential in 3D Design on the simulation side 
of thins: stereolithography technology (To come: not yet doable), simulation is pretty much doabale with GPU and AI super cheap (factor here needed making process easier --> https://www.neuralconcept.com/ They just do the simulation and driving simulation cost with Machine Learning. We combine the whole creative, communicative process of 3D Design (AIM: Ideation to production in least amount of steps Goal of my company)

Things to check: OpenSfM Tool, 3D Modelling, poseNet, center, dextr, grab, psp (lip), etc...
